            "When we talk about OSHA, we refer to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or by its acronym in English as Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA, which came into force in the United States in 1971. Therefore, it does not The term OSHA should be confused with what the OHSAS standard is.",
            "Previously in 1970, the United States was experiencing a high rate of workplace accidents, so the president of that time, Richard M. Nixon, took measures to reduce these unfortunate incidents, for which he signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act a December 29, 1970. This new standard, known as the OSH Act, created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA, which officially came into effect on April 28, 1971.",
            "This is how this entity is established as an agency of the United States Department of Labor, whose headquarters are located in the city of Washington DC, where its primary mission is to enforce laws related to the safety and health of workers. Also highlight that the head of this agency is the assistant secretary of labor in charge of Occupational Safety and Health matters.",
            "Currently, this entity is in charge of establishing and imposing protective standards, which reach both employers and workers, through technical assistance and specialized advisory programs, being highly recognized and accepted internationally due to the seriousness and competence with which it establishes the standards responsible for managing Occupational Risk Prevention in the best way.",
            "In this way, the OSHA entity and its state partners have a large staff of professionals, among which there are approximately 2,400 inspectors and just over 550 state advisors, as well as investigators of complaints about discrimination issues, field engineers, medical evaluators, and technical and support staff, which are strategically distributed in more than 130 active offices throughout the United States and countries of influence.",
            "Today, according to OSHA principles, employers are responsible for providing a workplace that is safe and healthy for all their employees. That is, OSHA's role is first and foremost to ensure the safety and health of employees. workers, through the implementation and compliance with standards, as well as training, training, and the promotion of continuous improvement in processes related to safety and health at work.",
            "This is how this entity works to guarantee the safety and health of all workers in the United States and the countries of influence, who in their vast majority fall under the jurisdiction of OSHA, however this entity also offers its services to doctors, lawyers , journalists, scientists, engineers, intellectuals and personnel who work in other government entities.",
            "It should also be noted that part of OSHA's mission is to provide assistance or advice to employers, with the aim of reducing or eliminating hazards in the workplace, for which OSHA provides a wide variety of informational material. as well as specialized training material that focuses on several specific risks that compromise health and safety at work.",
            "In this way, OSHA is prepared to support both employers and employees in establishing a safe and healthy workplace. Thus, since the Occupational Safety and Health Act created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in 1970, it has been has managed to reduce occupational deaths by 60%, and occupational injuries and illnesses have also decreased by 40%, which is positive despite the fact that the level of employment in the United States increased significantly, reaching the exorbitant number of more than 115 million employees.",
            "Also clarify that OSHA provisions only cover what would be the private sector, however some states have implemented their own occupational safety and health programs that cover both regional and state workers, which have been previously approved by OSHA." ,
            "The truth is that since OSHA was created in the United States, this country has made significant progress in the field of occupational safety and health, so much so that OSHA and its numerous partners in the public and private sectors have managed to reduce the rate of occupational deaths recorded from 2002 to 2008 at very low and much more acceptable levels.",
            "Finally, do not forget that the OSH Act promotes the creation and operation of occupational safety and health plans within each state, thereby preventing state oversight of OSHA standards unless the state has an approved plan. This way, OSHA approves and tracks all state plans, which must be at least as effective as the federal OSHA program.",
            "Therefore, state plans that cover the entire private sector must also cover state and regional government employees. In addition, OSHA rules also allow states to develop plans that cover only public sector workers, leaving the private sector under the control or federal jurisdiction of OSHA."
